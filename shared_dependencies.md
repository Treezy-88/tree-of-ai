Shared Dependencies:

1. Libraries: All files will share dependencies on several libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLTK, spaCy, and Dialogflow. These libraries will be imported in multiple files.

2. User Intents: Defined in "intents.py", these will be used in "chatbot.py" to map user intents to actions, and in "actions.py" to implement the corresponding actions.

3. Actions: Defined in "actions.py", these will be used in "chatbot.py" to perform actions based on user intents, and in "action_handlers.py" to handle the execution of these actions.

4. Utility Functions: Defined in "utils.py" and "nlp_utils.py", these will be used across multiple files for tasks like data preprocessing, tokenization, and entity recognition.

5. Integration Functions: Defined in "dialogflow_integration.py", "spacy_integration.py", "nltk_integration.py", "tensorflow_integration.py", and "pytorch_integration.py", these will be used in "chatbot.py" and "actions.py" to integrate with the respective APIs and libraries.

6. Data Schemas: The data schemas used for training the AI Bot and AI Agents will be shared across multiple files. These schemas define the structure of the data used for training and will be used in "chatbot.py", "actions.py", and the integration files.

7. Model Parameters: The parameters of the machine learning models used for training the AI Bot and AI Agents will be shared across multiple files. These parameters will be used in "chatbot.py", "actions.py", and the integration files.

8. Error Messages: Any error messages or exceptions will be shared across multiple files. These messages will be used in "chatbot.py", "actions.py", and the integration files to handle errors and exceptions.

9. Configuration Variables: Any configuration variables, such as API keys or environment variables, will be shared across multiple files. These variables will be used in "chatbot.py", "actions.py", and the integration files to configure the chatbot and its integrations.
