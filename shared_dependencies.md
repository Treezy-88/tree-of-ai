Shared Dependencies:

1. Data Schemas: All files will share a common data schema for the AI Bot and AI Agents. This includes schemas for user interactions, agent actions, and training data.

2. Function Names: Functions such as preprocess_data(), train_model(), create_agent(), and deploy_agent() will be shared across multiple files. Utility functions for natural language processing and machine learning will also be shared.

3. Libraries: All files will share dependencies on several libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, and Dialogflow. These libraries will be imported and used in multiple files.

4. Variables: Shared variables may include the AI Bot's current state, the training data, the list of AI Agents, and the user's prompts. These variables will be used and updated across multiple files.

5. Message Names: Message names for user prompts and AI Bot responses will be shared across multiple files. These may include names like 'user_prompt', 'bot_response', 'action_result', etc.

6. ID Names: If the AI Bot interacts with a user interface, ID names for relevant DOM elements will be shared across files. These may include names like 'user_input_field', 'response_display_area', 'action_button', etc.

7. Action Names: Names for the various actions that the AI Bot and AI Agents can perform will be shared across multiple files. These may include names like 'retrieve_information', 'execute_command', 'provide_recommendation', etc.

8. Intent Names: Names for the different intents that the AI Bot can recognize will be shared across multiple files. These may include names like 'ask_question', 'give_command', 'request_recommendation', etc.
